This project is made to get knowledge about python AI building libraries like hugging face and its modules such as 
  Transformers, pipeline for gpt, flask for WebAPI Generation, CORS for protocols and React for frontEnd. Although
  the gpt2 pre trained module of hugging face gives a little dumb and big answers but it is still good for practice 
  purpose.
